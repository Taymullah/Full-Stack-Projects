# Context Behind the Cars4U Used Car Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview

The Cars4U project is an end-to-end data science project aimed at building a predictive model for used car prices. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of data science principles to a real-world problem and showcase a range of technical skills, from data analysis to model deployment. The dataset for this project was given by MIT's Applied Data Science Program.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: The dataset requires extensive data cleaning to deal with missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This phase aims to prepare the data for analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding key trends and relationships in the data, such as the impact of mileage and car age on pricing. Visualizations are key in identifying patterns.
  
- **Model Development**: Building a robust regression model using a Random Forest Regressor to predict the price of used cars. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning play a crucial role in improving model accuracy.
  
- **Deployment Strategy**: Although deployment is not included in this iteration, the future goal is to deploy the model via a web-based interface where users can input car details and receive a predicted price.

## Intended Outcomes

The expected outcomes of this project include:

- A functional predictive model that accurately estimates the price of used cars based on input features.
- Clear insights derived from the dataset that can be visualized and communicated to non-technical stakeholders.
- A showcase project that highlights my technical skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

## Challenges Addressed

While building this project, several challenges were addressed:

- **Handling Missing and Inconsistent Data**: Missing values and inconsistent entries were dealt with using a combination of imputation techniques and domain knowledge.
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most relevant features for the model to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like MAE (mean absolute error) and $R^{2}$ and making iterative improvements.

## Summary

This project serves as a case study in applying data science techniques to a complex, real-world problem. The process of cleaning data, performing exploratory analysis, and building a predictive model demonstrates a comprehensive approach to solving a business problem using data-driven insights.
